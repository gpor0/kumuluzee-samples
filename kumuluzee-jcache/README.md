# KumuluzEE JCache sample

This sample shows basic usage of JCache static and dynamic configuration, usage of JCache annotations, programmatic API, CDI producers for Cache object and JCache listener registration.

A simple postman collection is included for testing.

# Requirements

In order to run this example you will need the following:

1. Java 8 (or newer), you can use any implementation:
    * If you have installed Java, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
        
        ```
        java -version
        ```

2. Maven 3.2.1 (or newer):
    * If you have installed Maven, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
        
        ```
        mvn -version
        ```
3. Git:
    * If you have installed Git, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
    
        ```
        git --version
        ```

# Tutorial

First create a basic rest application, you can refer to `kumuluzee-rest` sample for that.

## Add JCache dependency

Add `kumuluzee-jcache-caffeine` dependency to your root pom.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee.jcache</groupId>
    <artifactId>kumuluzee-jcache-caffeine</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## REST API

We create 3 different API endpoints for different test cases.

```java
//This endpoint will invoke @CachePut to simulate storing to cache
@POST
@Path("/{id}")
public Response addData(@PathParam("id") String id, InvoiceData in) {
    InvoiceData data = invoiceService.putInvoice(id, in);
    return Response.ok(data).build();
}

//This endpoint will invoke @CacheResult to return cached result from the first method 
//or store a mock object if cache is empty.
@GET
@Path("/{id}")
public Response getData(@PathParam("id") String id) {
    InvoiceData data = invoiceService.getInvoice(id);
    return Response.ok(data).build();
}

//This endpoint will invoke cache named "default" and simulate @CacheResult programmatically
@GET
@Path("/{id}/default")
public Response getInvoicesDefault(@PathParam("id") String id) {
    InvoiceData data = invoiceService.getInvoiceDefault(id);
    return Response.ok(data).build();
}
```

Our business logic will implement the following interface:
```java
public interface InvoiceService {

    //@CachePut
    InvoiceData putInvoice(String key, InvoiceData data);

    //@CacheResult
    InvoiceData getInvoice(String key);

    //Programatic API
    InvoiceData getInvoiceDefault(String key);
}
```

## JCache annotations

For our JCache annotations we will use a cache named `invoices`. The first step is to configure it in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
kumuluzee:
  jcache:
    enabled: true
    caffeine:
      caffeine.jcache:
        invoices:
          key-type: java.lang.String
          value-type: com.kumuluz.ee.samples.jcache.rest.lib.InvoiceData
          policy:
            eager-expiration:
              after-write: "15s"
            maximum:
              size: 2
```
Cache will take `String` as a key and `InvoiceData` object as value. Entries eagerly expire after 15 seconds and maximum number of entries in cache is 2.

Let's implement `InvoiceService`. The put method only stores data to cache and returns the same data. We want to use the path ID parameter as the cache key, so we annotate it with `@CacheKey`. We want to store the POST body as value, so we annotate it with `@CacheValue`.
```java
@CachePut(cacheName = "invoices")
@Override
public InvoiceData putInvoice(@CacheKey String key, @CacheValue InvoiceData data) {
    return data;
}
```

If we call this endpoint now:
```
POST http://localhost:8080/invoices/123
{
	"id": "123456"
}
```
We can't really see anything yet since data is only stored to cache and immediately returned.

Implementing the getter:
```java
@CacheResult(cacheName = "invoices")
public InvoiceData getInvoice(@CacheKey String key) {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(3000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return new InvoiceData("654321");
}
```

We use the same path ID parameter as cache key. If the key is already present, `@CacheResult` will return the cached value, otherwise a mock data is returned and cached. A sleep of 3 seconds is added to simulate slow business logic.
Also note that we use the same named cache called `invoices` so both annotations operate on the same cache.

To test it, run the application and load the included postman collection.

1. CachePut+CacheResult test
```
POST http://localhost:8080/invoices/123
{
	"id": "123456"
}
```
```
GET http://localhost:8080/invoices/123
```
Executing both calls one after the other, we get a very fast response (t<3s) from the GET method due to value already existing in cache.
Waiting 15 seconds and executing GET again results in t>3s due to cache entry eagerly expiring and mock object id of `654321`.

2. CacheResult test
```
GET http://localhost:8080/invoices/123
```
Simply executing the call repeatedly will cause a slow call every 15 seconds.

3. CacheResult max entries test
```
GET http://localhost:8080/invoices/1
GET http://localhost:8080/invoices/2
GET http://localhost:8080/invoices/3
```
Execute each GET request twice. First call is slow, second is fast. After executing #3, calling #2 is fast but calling #1 is  slow. That is because we reached max entry size of 2 and earliest entry is evicted from cache.

## JCache programmatic API

Finally, let's implement an equivalent to `@CacheResult` with programmatic API. First, configure a cache named `default`.

```yaml
kumuluzee:
  jcache:
    enabled: true
    caffeine:
      caffeine.jcache:
        default:
          policy:
            eager-expiration:
              after-write: "10s"
            maximum:
              size: 10000
```

Programmatic API revolves around the `Cache` object which is thread safe and a single instance per named cache should exist for our application. Therefore we need an application scoped producer.

```java
public class CacheProducer {

    @Inject
    private CacheManager cacheManager;

    @DefaultCache
    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public Cache<String, InvoiceData> getDefaultCache() {
        return cacheManager.getCache("default");
    }
}
```
Since `default` is already configured in `config.yaml` we can simply get the cache from the manager. If we have multiple Cache producers we also add a producer qualifier to differentiate the injects:
```java
@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface DefaultCache {
}
```

Implement the business logic method:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class InvoiceServiceImpl implements InvoiceService {

    @DefaultCache
    @Inject
    private Cache<String, InvoiceData> defaultCache;

    @Override
    public InvoiceData getInvoiceDefault(String key) {

        if (defaultCache.containsKey(key)) {
            return defaultCache.get(key);
        }
        else {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            InvoiceData d = new InvoiceData(key);
            defaultCache.put(key, d);
            return d;
    }
}
```

You can also find a `my` named cache in the sample code which demonstrates how to dynamically configure a `Cache` instead of using a config file.
